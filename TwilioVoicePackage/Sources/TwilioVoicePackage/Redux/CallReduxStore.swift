///
///  Store: Store holds the state. Store receives the action and passes on to the reducer
///  and gets the updated state and passes on to the subscribers.
///  It is important to note that you will only have a single store in an application.
///  If you want to split your data handling logic,
///  you will use reducer composition i.e using many reducers instead of many stores.
///
///  Example:
///  private let store: CallReduxStore = Store(initialState: .init(userSession: nil), reducer: callReducer)
///
